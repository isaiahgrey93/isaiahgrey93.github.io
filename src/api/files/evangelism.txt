From writing content tutorials to attending meetups talking to various types of developers; I've learned developer evangelism is tricky business.

Developers can be a rather strange breed, often writing software for the masses to buy, but often reluctant to pay for software themselves.

Take Sublime Text, which has a unlimited trial evaluation period, is a hardened battle proven tool many use on a daily basis; but yet many or most likely a majority will never buy a license for. (Granted it is unlimited free trial, but still it's less thatn $100 for something most use every day.)

This probably stems from the rapidly evolving nature of software and it's tooling. Investing in a tool monetarily might be the lesser cost of using a new tool.
Point being, trying to understand where developers are coming from, and the challenges they face using your tools is key to effective evangelism.

Developer empathy is a must have for a developer evangelist.
