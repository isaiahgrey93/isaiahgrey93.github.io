    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      I am a father of two(soon to be three), husband, and a software engineer with a love for learning and building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Originating from rural northern Idaho, I group up outside any influence of a tech community. I came to a realization about using code to build tools to solve problems shortly after I turned 20 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      This realization came about from remembering a time my eldest sibling built a game on his calculator in assembly. Needless to say, after I tried programming myself, I did not want to stop learning.
