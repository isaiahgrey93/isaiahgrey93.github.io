Being a teacher was a very rewarding experience, and I still think of myself being in that capcity as an evangelist.

I think more than ever, we need people in the developer community to build tutorials, videos on how to get into programming.

As a teacher I always emphasized for my students to not be afraid to break things. That they should not be afraid to get their hands dirty in coding as that is the best way to learn; learning by doing.
