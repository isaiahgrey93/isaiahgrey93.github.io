      I used <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong> to create a mini-sublime text editor so people could learn more about me and the work I been a part of in a familar enviornment; well at least if you are a developer it will/may be familar..

    <p>
      Of course you won't be able actually edit my files, but you will be able to read them :)
      If you find this more annoying than cool(don't worry I get it), and just wanna know more about me, head to the resume folder where you can read about me without all the... <em>things</em>.
